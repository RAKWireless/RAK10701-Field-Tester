The RAK10701-P Field Tester for LoRaWAN is a ready-to-use WisNode for evaluating deployed LoRaWAN network, which comes in a hard case and two different antenna types. It has a GNSS and a touchscreen LCD for the user interface, which displays the number of gateways the device can reach and other parameters like approximate distance, RSSI, and SNR. It is powered by a rechargeable battery and can be charged via USB Type-C interface.

When deploying LoRaWAN Gateways, it is crucial to know whether they are far enough away from each other and if the area that should be covered by the gateways is in range at any location. It is important to locate the dead spots in your LoRaWAN network coverage.

When deploying LoRaWAN sensor nodes, it is crucial to know whether all sensor nodes are in the range of a gateway or hotspot.

With a LoRaWAN Field Tester , it is now easy to investigate whether the required area of sensor nodes is covered by gateways or if there are blind spots in which the sensor data cannot reach any gateway.

## _Important_

:exclamation: _**This source code is based on RAKwireless RUI3 V4.1.1. Please check the RUI3 documentation how to install the RUI3 BSP's**_    
If you need to compile the source code with an older RUI3 version, the branch [RAK10701-P-L.v1.0.6](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK10701-Field-Tester/tree/RAK10701-P-L.v1.0.6) is compatible with RUI3 versions 4.1.0 and older.    
:exclamation:

# :collision: _**Some libraries used in this application are changed to work with RUI3. To make compilation easier, the required libraries are included in the source code in the folder `Src/libraries`. This way it is not required to install the libraries manually.**_ :collision:
